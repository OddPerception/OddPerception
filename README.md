Finding meaning in a world devoid.

What gives you meaning in your life? Have you given that any thought? I think about it occasionally and I cant come to a definitive answer. 
Is life about happiness? Is life about  the continuation of what I was taught? Is it to be satisfied? Is it to pass on large amounts of value 
to those who care little about how that value was created? 

Im sitting around wondering about meaning. What is it? Would I be happy if I found it? I have listened to a particular amount of voices all 
talking about the meaning of life. They all have so many different ideas about what a happy life looks like. 

The ideal life. The perfect life. A life that is devoid of pain.

I sit around here and wonder about that. Devoid of pain. Those particular words have a different ring to them than happy donâ€™t they? 
Do you know why? Its the things you picture in your mind when you hear those words. They articulate something else. 

Maybe those words are doing more than you think they are.

I think often about Albert Camus. He spoke about the indifference of the universe. Not that it is against us only that it is one of us. 
It is something eternal as we are. An ancient byproduct of time. The thing that always is and always will be.

I have looked into the meaning of shape and form as it relates to my identity. The things that are the essence of who we are and those 
fragments that others piece together of us.

Do they know us? Truly? Most likely not. Does that change the way you see yourself? I think a lot about how it changes my perception of 
myself. Not negatively necessarily but it does somehow distort it. Does how I consider my ideas really matter if I cannot articulate them in a way that explains them perfectly?

Have wars been fought merely because of mistranslation? 

Of course life usually does not hinge upon war and death or the idea of peace. It depends on ephemeral interactions of non significance. 
But in the grand scheme they are all significant. They are determinate. 

In ephemeral interactions things play out in a determined way because of those small irrelevant decisions. But I guess therein lies the 
paradox. Do those small decisions determine our fate or does our fate lie in those tiny decisions?
